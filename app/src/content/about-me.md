# Hey, welcome to my site!

Having started coding at the age of 11 it has always been my biggest passion.

In 2010 I commercially started creating websites and apps and have been doing it ever since.

I describe myself as a full stack developer who specializes in creating beautiful and intuitive frontends with an added focus on clean and maintainable code.
