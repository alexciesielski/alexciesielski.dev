Having started coding at the age of 11 it has always been my biggest passion.

In 2012 I completed my CS degree at the Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology in Warsaw, Poland.

As a software engineer I specialize in frontend development, creating beautiful and intuitive frontends with
an added focus on clean and maintainable code. This is complemented by a strong interest in programming in general.

I am also a big fan of open source and I contribute actively to many projects, not only by opening issues, but
actively implementing features and fixing bugs.
