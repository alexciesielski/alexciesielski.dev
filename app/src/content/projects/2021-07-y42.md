Implemented a web-worker based Git client using `wasm-git` under the hood, with advanced Typescript functionality like type inference and mapping for a superior developer experience.

Integrated `monaco` (VS Code) as a code editor, which allowed developers to work hands-on with the data pipelines they were building.

Prepared a scalable project structure with `nx` based on reusable core libraries, which got extended in the final feature implementations (domain-driven), which allowed for better separation of concerns and a wider coverage of tests.

Implemented a CICD pipeline, which cached the `node_modules` folder which then got reused in parallelized checks, like `lint` and `test`, for blazing fast pull requests.

Integrated `Storybook` into the dev workflow, which especially in the light of large reload times meant a significant decrease in iteration times.
