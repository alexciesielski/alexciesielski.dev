I have put great value in developing a intuitive and perfomant UX, since the old system used to crash and lose data very often. That’s why the UI was supposed to take over as much work from the user as possible.
I made heavy use of Angular’s reactive form module by developing custom form controls (e.g. list of ingredients) with complex validation logic.
