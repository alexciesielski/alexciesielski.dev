As part of the two-app package I also implemented a backoffice app for the bank's employees to manage the exchange rates and client accounts. The app was designed to be used on desktops and tablets, and was built with Angular Material. I also implemented a custom charting solution for visualizing the exchange rates over time, using the Google Visualization API.

Another feature that has been added to both apps is a realtime chat, that provides a negotiation functionality for customer's that want to exchange a very large sum. The bank's employees are presented with a notification to handle this kind of transaction and a chat window is opened to negotiate the exchange rate.
