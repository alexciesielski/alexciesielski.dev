The application is a single page application that is used by clinical researchers to manage their clinical trials. The application is built with Angular 10 and uses a custom design system. I was responsible for the frontend architecture, the implementation of new features, and the maintenance of the application. I also helped to improve the development process by introducing new tools and best practices.
