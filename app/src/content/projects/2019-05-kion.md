The first project was a backoffice application that allowed to query and filter a database of forklifts, edit their characteristics and find and fix possible errors in data.
The second app allowed to query and filter a database of clients, while the third app allowed the sales team to create sales offers to facilitate sales and renting of forklifts to clients.
