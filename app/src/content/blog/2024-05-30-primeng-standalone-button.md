# The `primeng/button` is now a standalone Angular component and directive

My pull request to the PrimeNG library was merged, and the `primeng/button` component is now a standalone Angular component and directive. This change simplifies the usage of buttons in PrimeNG, making it easier to integrate them into your Angular applications.
